# bill-calculator-cpp
A Bill Calculator in C++ that I created as part of an assignment, during my studies towards my Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology.

## Description:
This console program calculates a user's monthly bill for a cellular telephone company. The company offers two different services ("Regular" and "Premimum"), each with their own base rates and per-minute charges. The program prompts the user to input their account number, service type and usage details, then computes and displays the user's total bill.

Services and Rates:
- Regular Service: R100 base + First 50 minutes free + R2 per minute (for each minute over 50)
- Premium Service: R250 base +
  - First 75 minutes free for calls between 06:00 and 18:00 + R1 per minute (for each minute over 75)
  -  First 100 miniutes free for calls between 18:00 and 06:00 + R0.5 per minute (for each minute over 100)

## How to Build and Run:
### Requirements:
- C++ compiler (I used Visual Studio Code/ CodeBlocks, but you may also use g++, clang++, etc.)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Build and Run Manually
